This assignment asks you to generate the states of 15 puzzle.  The 15
puzzle is a popular game.  There are 15 squares in a 4 x 4 box.  One
is empty.  The solved state is shows below

1  2  3  4
5  6  7  8
9  A  B  C
D  E  F  -

Here, we use A to F for numbers 10 to 15. - is the space.  To play
this game, you can move the space.  For example, moving - up changes
the state to

1  2  3  4
5  6  7  8
9  A  B  -
D  E  F  C

Moving - left changes the state to

1  2  3  4
5  6  7  8
9  A  -  B
D  E  F  C

To solve this state, you can move - right and down.  However, if
you move it down and right, you will get this state

1  2  3  4
5  6  7  8
9  A  F  B
D  E  C  -

To make it simple, we will express each state by a single line from
the upper left side to the lower right side.  The solved state is
expressed as

12345678ABCDEF- 

There is no space between the numbers.

123456789A-BDEFC expresses the following state

1  2  3  4
5  6  7  8
9  A  -  B
D  E  F  C

Please notice that we do not use "10"; we use "A" instead.
